### Project
* Population vs GHGs
* 1990 to 2019 data available for both sets

* Calculate population and emissions for 2020-2021, 2050
* Database
* Graphs
-> Can use sources found online to add to project

### Recommendations
# Sara:
* Use 1990-2015 as training
* Test for 2016+ (see how close numbers are to actual values)
